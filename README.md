### News
* 2026-06: A new feature is now available to save maps as `.pcd` files. The `RESPLE` node exposes a `save_map` service to save the ikd-tree map on demand. A new `MapSaving` node is also available to accumulate and save the dense global map published by the `Mapping` node. Please check out the branch [here](https://github.com/ASIG-X/RESPLE/tree/feature/save_map).
* 2026-01: A new feature is now available to save estimated trajectories specifically for benchmarking. Please check out the branch [here](https://github.com/ASIG-X/RESPLE/tree/feature/benchmark). An example using the HelmDyn dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/ASIG-X/RESPLE/blob/feature/benchmark/resple/config/config_helmdyn01.yaml). The estimated trajectory will be generated through spline interpolation at ground-truth timestamps in a `.txt` file following the [TUM format](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/evo/wiki/Formats).
* 2025-12: The design of a handheld demostrator for RESPLE is now publicly available. Check out our web page [here](https://asig-x.github.io/resple_demonstrator/).
* 2025-12: Additional evaluation results of RESPLE-LIO and corresponding parameter sets on the [Newer College](https://ori-drs.github.io/newer-college-dataset/) dataset (including its extension) and the [MCD](https://mcdviral.github.io/) dataset are now available on our [web page](https://asig-x.github.io/resple_web/add_evaluation.html). Instructions for testing are given below.
* 2025-09: The [TudoRun](https://asig-x.github.io/resple_web/datasets.html) dataset is released as a supplementary dataset.


This is the offcial repository for RESPLE, the first B-spline-based recursive state estimation framework for estimating 6-DoF dynamic motions. Using RESPLE as the estimation backbone, we developed a unified suite of direct LiDAR-based odometry systems, including:
* LiDAR-only odometry (LO)
* LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO)
* Multi-LiDAR odometry (MLO)
* Multi-LiDAR-inertial Odometry (MLIO)

These four variants have been tested in real-world datasets and our own experiments, covering aerial, wheeled, legged, and wearable platforms operating in indoor, urban, wild environments with diverse LiDAR types. We look forward to your comments and feedback!

### Docker

With the docker image built (see docker build instructions), one can run the run the algorithm in a docker container by following these steps.

Allow the docker user to generate graphics:
```bash
xhost +local:docker
```

Replacing `/path/to/data` with the location of the datasets, run the container (with mounted source code for development):
```bash
docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v .:/root/ros2_ws/src/RESPLE \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix/:/tmp/.X11-unix/ \
  -v ~/data/resple_dataset/:/root/data/resple_dataset \
  -v ~/data/grand_tour_box/datasets:/root/data/grand_tour_box/datasets \
  --name resple resple
```
Note: To recompile inside the docker container run `colcon build --packages-up-to resple`. If no development is intended, then one can omit `-v .:/root/ros2_ws/src/RESPLE`.

Replacing `<filename>` with the launch file from above, launch with:
```bash
ros2 launch resple <filename>.launch.py
```

Create a second terminal attached to the container with:
```bash
docker exec -it resple bash
```

In this second container, replacing `<example>/<filename>` to make a valid bag filepath, play the dataset:
```bash
ros2 bag play ~/data/resple_dataset/<example>/
```

If the container is already run, then:
* It can be removed with:
```bash
docker rm resple
```
* It can be started with:
```bash
docker start resple
```
* It can be be attached to with:
```bash
docker attach resple
```
* It can be stopped with:
```bash
docker stop resple
```

### M445 excavator

`ros2 launch resple resple_excavator.launch.py` starts RESPLE and Mapping with
`resple/config/resple_excavator.yaml`. Pass `use_sim_time:=true` in Newton.
The config reads the self-filtered Mid-360 PointCloud2 and `/hal/box_imu`.
Its LiDAR extrinsics follow the M445 URDF. The Mid-360 subscriptions accept
sensor QoS, so the excavator's filtered cloud and IMU connect directly.

With `publish_accumulated_map: true`, Mapping keeps one lowest point per
configured 3D voxel and publishes complete point-map snapshots at the
configured period (1 Hz for M445). It aligns its internal `world` coordinates
to the machine's `map` frame using the RESPLE spline pose and the machine's
`map` to `imu_box_link` transform. The output topic is
`/m4/lidar/point_cloud_map`; `/m4/lidar/clear_points` clears it. Other launch
configurations retain the original per-scan `/global_map` behavior.
